# Friends List App

This is an example app I made, following along a tutorial by John Elder on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg&t=2245s). It's pretty basic; but what's really cool is how quick it was to set-up the CRUD system, and how easy it was to style it in Bootstrap.

I might make another Ruby/Rails app in the future just because of how easy this was, and how much it reminds me of Elixir.

It uses Devise for authentication, and bootstrap for styling.
